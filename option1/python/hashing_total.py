# Starter code for a hash table, submitted for the "TOTAL" challenge
# This hashtable should occupy no more than 100 KiB of memory.
# It should be optimized to minimize the *total* time it takes to
#   insert 1000 integers and query 1000 integers, uniformly distributed
#   between INT_MIN and INT_MAX

class Hashtable_Total:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Implement the constructor
        ...
    
    def insert(self, x):
        # TODO: Insert x into the hash table. Do not return anything.
        ...
    
    def query(self, x):
        # TODO: Return True if x is in the hash table, False otherwise.
