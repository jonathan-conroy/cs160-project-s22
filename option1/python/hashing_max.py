# Starter code for a hash table, submitted for the "MAX" challenge
# This hashtable should occupy no more than 100 KiB of memory.
# It should be optimized to minimize the *maximum* time it takes to
#   execute a single query, after inserting 1000 integers uniformly distributed
#   between INT_MIN and INT_MAX.
